# Student-s-Performance-Prediction
The file Predict Models_Phat.ipynb trains over 30 models, then selects the best-performing model to use for building a website. All necessary files for building the website are fully shared in the Flask_App folder. Once the website is running locally, Docker is used to create a Docker image and deploy it to Microsoft Azure.

Check the accuracy of the models when making a prediction on a sample.
